# Programming Assignment 3

## Course: CSCI 360 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Suggestion
For clarity in your work, we recommend using Jupyter Notebook to organize your tasks. Use clear Markdown sections to indicate the specific question you are addressing and the corresponding results.
e.g. 
```
# Question 1(b) i. code part

code here

# Question 1(b) i. result part

plotting code

<plot>
```

## Writing your code

- All of the code that will be evaluated and graded will live in
[`lab3.py` or `lab3.ipynb`] (only choose one, not both).
- You can use any python package that is installed by `pip` or `conda`
when you created the environment.
